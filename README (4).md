# Azure Text Analytics Reflection

This repository documents my hands-on experience using **Microsoft Azure Text Analytics**, a part of Azure Cognitive Services. The goal was to explore its capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP) through tasks like language detection, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, and entity recognition.

---

## 🧠 Overview

In this project, I:

- Explored **Language Detection** for multilingual inputs
- Evaluated **Sentiment Analysis** with complex, neutral statements
- Extracted **Key Phrases** from textual data
- Used **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** for identifying entities in retail feedback
- Investigated other Cognitive Services like **Speech to Text**, **Text to Speech**, and **Speaker Recognition**

---

## 🔍 Highlights

### 🌐 Multilingual Language Detection
Tested various languages including Indonesian; Azure accurately detected each input language.

### 😊 Sentiment Analysis
Tested the model’s ability to detect **neutral statements**—Azure successfully recognized and labeled them as neutral, showing more nuanced classification than expected.

### 🗣️ Cognitive Speech Services
Explored **Speech to Text**, **Text to Speech**, and **Speaker Identification**—great tools for voice-over content creators.

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- Formatting Output: Styling limitations (e.g., bold + colored text combined) within output code formatting were difficult to resolve.
- Cost Management: Accidentally depleted the initial $100 student credit by running multiple compute resources simultaneously.

## 🛒 Business Use Case: Retail Grocery Stores

I identified three potential applications of Azure Text Analytics in our family-run grocery business:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Understand customer emotions from reviews and feedback.
2. **Key Phrase Extraction**: Detect recurring themes (e.g., product issues, service quality).
3. **Entity Recognition**: Track product names and preferences for better inventory planning and marketing.

## 🏢 Real-World Example: Walmart’s Use of NLP

Inspired by how **Walmart** uses NLP in production:
- **Walmart Voice Order** and **Text to Shop** leverage NLP for voice-activated orders.
- Chatbots use **NLU** and multilingual support to resolve customer issues across global markets.
